odd or even
the computer will ask the user to input 2 numbers, the computer will then take those numbers and determine and tell the user if the number they put is 
odd or even.
peer reviewed by Daniel Decoito: The program works well and meets all criteria for the assignment. The data valadation is good, I could not find a way to break the program. The code is pretty well put together solid work, but since I am trying to help you improve I will say that You should try to shorten your code a little. Maybe use terenary operators or rexamine and simplify the logic. Overall tho great work.
